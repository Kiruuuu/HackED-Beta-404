The file HackED Beta Blackjack.py was created as a submission for the HackED Beta Hackathon in November 2021 by Thomas Yoo and Shahzaib Ahmed. The goal of the file is to serve as a very basic version of blackjack to be played by a single player against the dealer. As such, it cannot support more than a single playing at a single time. Also, due to time, complexity, and understanding constraints, the file does not truly play blackjack. There is no betting (therefore, no doubling down), no splitting of hands, no "announcement" if the player or dealer gets a blackjack (as jacks are instead just treated as a queen or king in terms of value. ie. card value of 10).
