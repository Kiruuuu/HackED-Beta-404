The file HackED Beta Blackjack.py was created as a submission for the HackED Beta Hackathon in November 2021 by Thomas Yoo and Shahzaib Ahmed. The goal of the file is to serve as a very basic version of blackjack to be played by a single player against the dealer. As such, it cannot support more than a single playing at a single time. Also, due to time, complexity, and understanding constraints, the file does not truly play blackjack. There is no betting (therefore, no doubling down), no splitting of hands, and no "announcement" if the player or dealer gets a blackjack. Additionally, due to both GUI spacing as well as simplicity, this game of blackjack operates similarly to something called "5 Card Charlie"; however, instead of the player winning when their hand has five cards, they instead are simply no longer able to hit.
